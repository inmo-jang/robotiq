"""@package docstring
Command-line interface for sending simple commands to a ROS node controlling a S-Model gripper.

This serves as an example for publishing messages on the 'SModelRobotOutput' topic using the 'SModel_robot_output' msg type for sending commands to a S-Model gripper. In this example, only the simple control mode is implemented. For using the advanced control mode, please refer to the Robotiq support website (support.robotiq.com).
